# About eShopOnWeb

Microsoft's eShopOnWeb started out as a reference application for ASP.NET Core. It is now maintained by [NimblePros](https://nimblepros.com),

This is a sample ASP.NET Core reference application demonstrating a single-process (monolithic) application architecture and deployment model. If you're new to .NET development, read the [Getting Started for Beginners guide](/quick-start-guide).

If you're looking for the .NET Aspire eShop sample it's [dotnet/eShop](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop). Microsoft also recommends the [Reliable Web App patterns guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/web-apps/guides/enterprise-app-patterns/reliable-web-app/dotnet/guidance) for building web apps with [enterprise app patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/web-apps/guides/enterprise-app-patterns/overview).
